# Emotions Meter
Emotions Meter is my first project that I created using a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/dima806/facial_emotions_image_detection) module. It's a very basic and raw combination of packages to identify and display the emotions which are captured through your live video capture.
## Prerequisites
* Recommended IDE: Pycharm
* Packages Installation :-
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
